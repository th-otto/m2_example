CODE ( w : CARDINAL ....)

Allows the insertion of machine code into the object code of the compiling
module. Each parameter w represents one 16-bit instruction to be executed.
The procedure has an arbitrary number of parameters separated by the
character ",".

SETREG ( regNum : CARDINAL; value: ADDRESS );
Procedure to generate code to set a value into one of the 68000
processors general purpose registers. regNum is the register number:
DO = 0 .. D7 = 7, AO = 8 .. A7 = 15

REGISTER ( regNuM : CARDINAL) : ADDRESS;
Procedure to generate code to return the contents of one of the 68000
processor s general purpose registers (see SETREGl.



$C : Generate the normal 68000 clear instructions to set variables to zero.
The only time this is not required is if you are trying to clear a register on a
device and the read before write operation of the clear cperation will cause a
problem.

$P: Generate the normal entry and exit code for the next procedure. The only
time this is not required is if a procedure is being jumped to from a machine
code instruction.

$S: Generate code at the entry of each procedure to check the stack space
available.

$T: Generate code to perform range checking on array subscripts etc.
    Index test (arrays, case).

$R: Subrange and type conversion test.

$A: short (bsr) calls

$H: block names?

$V: trapv

$U: allow underscores in identifiers
